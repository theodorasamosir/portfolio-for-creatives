        <h1 class="project-title">Personal Brand</h1>
        <p>For my school’s professional development class, I developed my personal brand. In it, I wanted to communicate the sense of exploration and expertise. I designed my logo to resemble both the letter T in the middle and an isometric cube – the most ubiquitous of 3D primitives. The arrows emerging from the center are also intended to resemble 3D gizmos, and represent growth in all directions, symbolizing versatility and expertise.</p>

        <p>I also wanted to use my logo as a canvas for 3D material rendering, especially glass which represents clarity and modernity. I chose the colour green for the brand as to me, it’s the colour of technology and progress.</p>

        <p>For my brand’s imagery, I used detailed 3D renders of abstract glass objects, and they act as spot illustrations on my websites and social media. They are in the image shown below a 3D rendering of my logo.</p>

        <p>From left to right, there is the Asteroid, representing grit and perserverance. the World – symbolizing exploration and connection, and the Fastener, representing logic and problem solving.</p>


        <p>As for type treatments I chose two typefaces – Raleway for any text collateral appearing on the web and for other collateral, Aileron. Both typefaces are clean and legible sans-serif with curved lowercase “l”s.</p>

        <p>This project was especially helpful in letting me look at brands in action – like the site you are on right now. </p>
